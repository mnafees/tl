# Designing a Terrible Language

I try to build a Terrible Language `tl` from scratch first prototyping the syntax using C++17 and macros, then writing a GCC frontend for it and finally creating an LLVM frontend for it.

- [Step 1: Using C++17 and macros for prototyping](https://github.com/mnafees/tl/tree/master/c++17-macros)
- [Step 2: Building a GCC frontend for `tl` [COMING SOON]](https://github.com/mnafees/tl/tree/master/gcc-frontend)
- [Step 3: Building a GCC frontend for `tl` [COMING SOON]](https://github.com/mnafees/tl/tree/master/llvm-frontend)
